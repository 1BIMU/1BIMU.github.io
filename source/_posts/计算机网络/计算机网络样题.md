2. (8 points) A datagram network allows routers to drop packets with a probability p. A source host is connected to a source router, which is connected to a destination router, and then to the destination host1 (a 3-hop path).

The maximum transmission rate (M) is 50 million bytes/sec. For how long can the flow sustain a burst at the maximum transmission rate?  
    
4. (8 points) Four organizations (A, B, C, D) request IP addresses from a large block starting at 198.16.0.0. The requests are for 4000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 addresses, respectively, and are fulfilled in that order. For organization C, provide:  
    
    a) The number of addresses that will be allocated.  
    
    b) The first IP address assigned.  
    
    c) The last IP address assigned.

Show the state of the congestion window at each step (RTT).  
    

### **Part V: Protocol Analysis (10 points)**  

_(Instructions: Analyze the following scenario and answer the questions.)_  

A TCP message containing 900 bytes of data and a 20-byte TCP header is sent from Host A to Host B. The path is A -> R1 -> R2 -> B. The IP header is 20 bytes. The links have the following Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs) for the _entire frame_:  

- **Link A-R1:** MTU = 1024 bytes (frame header = 14 bytes)  
- **Link R1-R2:** MTU = 512 bytes (frame header = 8 bytes)  
- **Link R2-B:** MTU = 512 bytes (frame header = 12 bytes)  

The IP datagram must be fragmented at router R1 to cross the R1-R2 link. Assume the original IP datagram has an Identification value of 555.  

Describe the IP fragments that are transmitted from R1 to R2. For each fragment, specify the following fields from its IP header:

### **Part IV: Short Answer and Calculation (40 points)**  

1. Answer:  
    
    The probability of a single frame arriving successfully is 0.8.  
    
    The probability of all 10 frames arriving successfully in one transmission is Psuccess​=(0.8)10≈0.10742424242.  
    
    The mean number of transmissions is a geometric distribution, given by 1/Psuccess​.  
    
    Mean number of transmissions = 1/0.107≈9.3 times43434343.  
    
2. Answer:  
    
    The probability of a router not dropping a packet is (1−p).  
    
    a) For a successful transmission, the packet must pass through both routers. The probability is Psuccess​=(1−p)⋅(1−p)=(1−p)244444444.  
    
    b) This is another geometric distribution. The mean number of transmissions is 1/Psuccess​.  
    
    Mean number of transmissions = 1/(1−p)245454545.  
    
3. Answer:  
    
    The formula for the duration of a burst (S) at maximum speed is S=B/(M−R), where B is the bucket size, M is the max rate, and R is the token rate46464646.  
    
    - B = 1,000,000 bytes  
    - M = 50,000,000 bytes/sec  
    - R = 10,000,000 bytes/sec S=1,000,000/(50,000,000−10,000,000)=1,000,000/40,000,000=0.025 seconds. The burst can last for **25 milliseconds**47474747.  
        
4. **Answer:**  
    
    - A needs 4000 addresses -> allocate 212=4096. Range: 198.16.0.0 to 198.16.15.255 (/20).  
    - B needs 2000 addresses -> allocate 211=2048. Range: 198.16.16.0 to 198.16.23.255 (/21).  
    - The next available address is 198.16.24.0. However, C needs 4000 addresses (block size 4096), which must start on a boundary divisible by the block size. The next such boundary after 198.16.23.255 is 198.16.32.0.  
    
    For organization C:  
    
    a) Allocated addresses: 409648484848.  
    
    b) First IP: 198.16.32.049494949.  
    
    c) Last IP: 198.16.47.25550505050.  
    
    d) Mask: /2051515151.  
    
5. Answer:  
    
    The receive window is 24 KB and MSS is 2 KB. The congestion window (cwnd) starts at 1 MSS (2 KB) and doubles each RTT until it reaches the slow start threshold52525252. The sending window is min(cwnd, receive window).  
    
    - **t=0:** Send 1 segment. cwnd = 2 KB.  
    - **t=1 RTT (10ms):** ACK received. cwnd = 2 * 2KB = 4 KB. Send 2 segments.  
    - **t=2 RTT (20ms):** ACKs received. cwnd = 2 * 4KB = 8 KB. Send 4 segments.  
    - **t=3 RTT (30ms):** ACKs received. cwnd = 2 * 8KB = 16 KB. Send 8 segments.  
    - **t=4 RTT (40ms):** ACKs received. cwnd = 2 * 16KB = 32 KB. At this point, the sending window = min(cwnd=32KB, recv_win=24KB) = 24 KB. It takes **4 RTTs, or 40 msec**, to send a full window53535353.  
        

### **Part V: Protocol Analysis (10 points)**  

**Analysis:**  

1. **Initial Datagram:** The total data payload for the IP datagram is 900 (TCP data) + 20 (TCP header) = 920 bytes. With a 20-byte IP header, the total IP datagram length is 940 bytes54545454.  
    
2. **MTU Calculation:**  
    - Link A-R1 IP MTU = 1024 - 14 = 1010 bytes. The 940-byte datagram passes without fragmentation.  
    - Link R1-R2 IP MTU = 512 - 8 = 504 bytes. The 940-byte datagram must be fragmented.  
3. **Fragmentation Logic:** The data portion of each fragment must be a multiple of 8 bytes (except for the last one).  
    - Max data in first fragment = 504 (IP MTU) - 20 (IP Header) = 484 bytes. The largest multiple of 8 less than or equal to 484 is 480 bytes.  
    - **Fragment 1:** Data = 480 bytes. Total Length = 480 + 20 = 500 bytes.  
    - **Remaining Data:** 920 - 480 = 440 bytes.  
    - **Fragment 2:** Data = 440 bytes. Total Length = 440 + 20 = 460 bytes.  

Answer:  

The two fragments transmitted from R1 to R2 are55555555:  

**Fragment 1:**  

- **Total Length:** 500  
- **Identification:** 555  
- **More Fragments (MF) bit:** 1 (true)  
- **Fragment Offset:** 0  

**Fragment 2:**  

- **Total Length:** 460  
- **Identification:** 555  
- **More Fragments (MF) bit:** 0 (false)  
- **Fragment Offset:** 60 (The offset is the data from the previous fragment(s) divided by 8: 480 / 8 = 60) 56565656
